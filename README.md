# competition

A tool for writing c++ projects for coding competitions.

# instructions

To run, type `./new.sh $PROJECT_NAME` into your linux terminal.  This will create a new project with a bunch of stuff already in it.

From there, you just have to add your code to the main.cpp file, and your input into the in.txt file.

# notes

Credit goes to [Michael Harvey](https://github.com/michaelh800) for making it and giving it to me.  Thanks!
